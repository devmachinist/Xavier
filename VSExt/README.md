## Reading HTML

The Framework also allows developers to read HTML throughout the entire document. This makes it easy for developers to work with HTML code in their .xavier files alongside their C# and JavaScript code.

## Conclusion

The Xavier Framework makes it easy for developers to easily identify and read .xavier files. With the help of this language recognition extension, developers can easily work with C#, JavaScript and HTML code in their .xavier files.
